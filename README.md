# CSCI 115 Term Project Part 2: Problem Solving and Analysis

## Brute force and optimized implementations of the TwoSum problem

This program takes two approaches to the TwoSum problem and uses a series of tests that compare the running time of a brute force solution and an optimized solution.
To run the program, simply download it, open the project in an IDE of your choice, then run and compile it. The program will display the best case, worst case, and 
average case running times for each algorithm.
