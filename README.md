# CSCI-115 Term Project (SP 2023)
### Part 1 - Comparison of Sorting Algorithms
The goal here is to implement and analyze various sorting algorithms, and how they compare with their theoretical analyses. The following sorting algorithms are used:

+ Insertion sort
+ Selection sort
+ Bubble sort
+ Merge sort
+ Quicksort 
+ Heapsort
+ Counting sort
+ Radix sort

### Operating System
PREFFERED OS: Linux or MacOs

Note that the experiments were done using Linux, which is the preferred operating system for running the algorithms. We noticed that Quick Sort, Couting Sort, and TwoSum do not run on Windows 11. All files will run on Linux and MacOS.

## Executable Shortcuts

To ensure ease of use, here are the executable names per folder:

| Sort        | Filename                 |
| ----------- | ------------------------ |
| Insertion   | ./insertionSortMergeSort |
| Selection   | ./quickSortSelectionSort |
| Bubble      | ./heapSortBubbleSort     |
| Merge       | ./insertionSortMergeSort |
| Quick       | ./quickSortSelectionSort |
| Heap        | ./heapSortBubbleSort     |
| Counting    | ./countSortRadixSort     |
| Radix       | ./countSortRadixSort     |
* Note: add ".exe" to executables if using Windows 10/11

### Directories
Within the home directory are folders for the sorting algorithms. Each folder contains two sorting algorithms, as contributed by a given group member. 

Data is specific to each algorithm, and is located within each sort's folder. There are six datasets, representative of n = 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 50000, and 100000. 

Within each data file are three datasets: best, worst, and average, respectively (in terms of time complexity).
